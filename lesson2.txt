To initialise an empty git repository we need to run git init
Working Directory is nothing but the current directory which contains the files.
It's better to have one commit per logical change.
Git Diff without any arguments let's us know the difference between the files in the staging area and
the Working Directory.
To check the difference between the staging area and the most recent commit we can use
git diff --staged
git reset --hard resets any changes made in the staging directory or the Working directory.

Branches:
=========
labels for commits are called Branches.
Master is the name given to the main branch in most Git repositories.
If we checkout a branch and make and then make a commit the branch label automatically updates
to the new commit and that branch remains checked out.
git branch can be used to see and create branches.git branch easy-mode(argument).
git log -graph --oneline allows us to visualise the branches made
git checkout -b <new-branch-name> this allows us to create and checkout branch at the same time.
git merge branch_name branch_name
After merging two branches to see the changes introduced by a particular commit in the commit log
we can use git show to show the changes that commit has introduced in comparison with it's parent.
To delete a branch we use git branch -d branch_name
